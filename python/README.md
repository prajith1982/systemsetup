## Creating a project 

### Setting up envirnment 
A Python virtual environment is an isolated Python installation that allows you to manage project-specific dependencies independently of your system-wide Python installation. Different projects may require different versions of the same libraries. Virtual environments prevent conflicts by creating isolated environments for each project.

`python -m venv the_envirnment_name`

python -m venv <the name  and this env specific for this project>


### activating the envirnment 
To activate the virtual environment, you need to run the activate script located in the bin
`./bin/activate`
